# RichTb example
An example shows the interface of Opticks with Geant4, based on the Rich Test Beam project (https://gitlab.cern.ch:8443/seaso/RichTbSimH) and CerenkovMinimal example (https://bitbucket.org/simoncblyth/opticks/src/master/examples/Geant4/CerenkovMinimal/).

1. How to use it? 
   Copy the RichTb directory to opticks/examples/Geant4/, and 
   `source build.sh` or `./build.sh clean` 
   `cd build && ./RichTb` 

2. The current running results can be found in RichTb_August_6.log. 
   The geometry is set properly, but no hits are collected.
